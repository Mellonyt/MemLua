# What is MemLua?
MemLua is a powerful memory-editing library for Lua, aimed towards DLL applications.
It may be used for exploiting or for debug/analysis of a project at run-time.

It was designed to replicate the Lua Engine of Cheat Engine, but being
that it is built around DLL's, it can offer a much wider range of capablities.
It can be used for high-quality exploit development,
making tedious time-consuming tasks possible in just 1 line of code.

Features include:
- Fast and efficient x86 disassembly/translation
- Fast memory scanning
- Safe, threaded detours that lua handles
- Automatic memory hooking
- Automatic calling conventions
- HTTP get for utilizing website data
- File reading/writing

The only thing you need to use MemLua are the MemLua API header files
and the Lua API itself.
