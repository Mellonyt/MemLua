// Emulated Virtual Machine for ROBLOX!
// 
// This relies not on instructions, but roblox's own stack!
// this method uses 30% of the functions a wrapper would use,
// yet has the same power and efficiency as a virtual machine!
// Imagine copying and pasting this instead of Axon! LOL!
// 
// Scripts can be executed with ease at astounding speeds!
// 
// ill be making this open-source along with the self-updating
// API and foundation that all my code is based on.
// This means that nothing can be patched!
// 
// Obviously, we know roblox likes to move stuff around
// (looking at you, ConvexHero!)
// So I'll continue to release updates for it unless silly roblox
// unterminates my OG account, `static`.
//
// Cheers!
