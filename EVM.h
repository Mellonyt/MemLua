// Emulated Virtual Machine for ROBLOX!
// 
// This relies not on instructions, but roblox's own stack!
// this method uses 30% of the functions a wrapper would use,
// yet has the same power and efficiency as a virtual machine!
// 
// this way, scripts can be executed with ease
// at astounding speeds! (who tf cares about speed in roblox)
// but most of all:
// 
// ill be making this open-source along with the self-updating
// API and foundation that all my code is based on.
// This means that nothing can be patched!
// 
// I'll continue to release updates for it unless silly roblox
// unterminates my OG account, `static`.
//
// I'm looking at you, ConvexHero!
//
